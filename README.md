  ## Code Overview
  in this work i created code for financial management.

  It allows users to manage their personal finances by tracking income, expenses, savings, and budgets.
  The system is designed to provide financial features such as:

	- Adding income and expenses
	- Tracking savings and adding interest
	- Creating and managing budgets
	- Displaying financial overviews

	- Account : represents a basic account that stores a balance and handles transactions.
	- SavingsAccount : extends the `Account` class to create interest calculation functionality.
	- Budget : manages a specific budget.
	- FinancialManager : is the main controller of the financial system.
